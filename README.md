# CODSOFT 

# The following are projects assigned to me during my one month Internship as a Machine Learning Engineer at CodSoft:

1. Bank customer churn prediction  
   
  - Overview:
   This project aims at predicting whether customers of a bank will leave based on various attributes. Customer churn is a significant concern in the banking sector, 
   as keeping current customers is usually more cost-efficient than attracting new ones.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
   
- Overview:
  This project aims at building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains information about credit card transactions, and we 
  are going experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

3. Mnist Dataset
- Overview:
The project aims as a benchmark for evaluating and comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of image recognition and classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 used for training and 10,000 for testing.
   
4. Movie Genre Classification
- Overview:
  This project aims at building a machine learning model to automatically categorizing movies into their respective genres based on various features such as title,description and year. 

5. Sms Spam Detection

- Overview:
  The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research.
  This project aims at building a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam or ham.
